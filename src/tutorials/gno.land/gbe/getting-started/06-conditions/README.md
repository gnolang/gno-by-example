In Gno, we have two ways to check for specific conditions:
- `if` statements
- `switch` statements:

```go file=./conditions.gno#L5-L13
```

```go file=./conditions.gno#L15-L29
```
Check out the full example [here](https://github.com/gnolang/gno-by-example/tree/main/src/tutorials/gno.land/gbe/06-conditions).
