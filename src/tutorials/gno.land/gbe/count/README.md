title: Counting
section: Section 1
---

Let's create our first application. This realm is able to add and substract from a global count variable using `Add()`
and `Remove()` methods. The state will be saved between executions.

<!--TODO: add an example about how to deploy this realm and how to call to Add() and Remove() using the command line -->

```go file=./count.gno
```

Tests:

```go file=./count_test.gno
```
